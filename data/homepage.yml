  title: "Who am I?"
  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    I am a <strong>passionate Software Engineer</strong> with a strong focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My enthusiasm lies in leveraging data science and analytics for business solutions. I enjoy leading and contributing to projects that make a meaningful impact. When I'm not developing software or working on AI projects, I relish opportunities to enhance my knowledge and skills in this domain, such as pursuing a Post-Graduate Certificate in Artificial Intelligence at Lambton College.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My area of expertise centers around creating AI-driven solutions, whether it's developing recommendation systems, deep-learning models for human action detection, or deploying systems on cloud platforms like Amazon's Elastic Container Services. I thrive on solving complex problems, and I take pride in my ability to communicate with stakeholders and work collaboratively with teams to make data-driven decisions that deliver value to companies.
